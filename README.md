# Diabetes_prediction
## **1. Data Collection**  
The data was gotten from UCI Machine learning repository
[Data_source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators)
## **2.Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis**  
The data was cleaned and exploratory data analysis was done on the data, so that we can understand the data
structure of the data
## **3.Data Preprocessing**  
* IsolationForest : Due to how highly imbalanced the data was, I used IsolationForest to detect the outliers
and anomaly in the dataset and they were removed
* I turned the categorical values into numerical
* I used StandardScalar to scale the categorical variables

## **4. Model Building**  
The main model was built using XGBClassifier
## **5. Hyperparameter Tuning**  
## **6. Model Evaluation**  
## **Model Deployment**
